# Unity Shader Experiments

This repository contains **Unity Shader Graph experiments**.

- **Main branch**: a clean template with minimal setup for testing shaders.  
- **Experiment branches**: individual shader projects based on the main branch.  

Branches can include shaders from tutorials or my own creations. The goal of this repository is to **document my experiments and track your learning progress**.
